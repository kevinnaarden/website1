          If you've ever been to any music event, you're probably very familiar
          with the term 'DJ'.<br />
          It might've crossed your mind at some point that this line of work
          requires specific gear for said DJ to perform on, as not all
          manufacturers' design language is compatible with one another.

          Gone are the days when DJ's would have to carry around their crates of
          vinyl records to travel with their music library; nowadays it's just
          as simple as plugging in a USB flash drive into the music player, also
          known as a <b>CDJ</b>. It's no longer necessary for them to haul along
          heavy luggage in order to bring their music with them. This is due to
          the technological advancements within the industry. Digitalization has
          allowed this type of performance to transform the way it did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formerly, before the digital music revolution in the mid-to-late
          2000's, DJ's would play and manipulate music on turntables. These
          tables would physically rotate their platter on which vinyl records
          could get played.

          Decades after the nascency of this craft, CD's started to gain
          tremendous popularity around the mid and late 80's - for their
          convenience. This didn't have any impact on the DJ industry at first,
          as DJ'ing was already quite an established form of performing.

            In 1998, Pioneer Corporation (Pioneer Electronics at the time)
            prematurely revolutionized the DJ industry with its product release
            of the first-ever DJ-dedicated digital music player that could read
            audio data from CD's instead of vinyl records; The <b>CDJ-100S</b>.

          Because the craft of DJ had already been around for decades, this
          convenient CD technology didn't become the industry standard for
          several more years (and also several CDJ successors later). When the
          <b>CDJ-1000</b> came around in 2001, however, this technology did
          change the industry for good. Having features such as looping
          user-specified parts of tracks, displaying the tempo of tracks in BPM
          (beats per minute) made the job of DJ's significantly easier, allowing
          them to focus more on track selection and engaging with the crowd and
          less on the technique behind the performance.<br /><br />

          The latest installment of the CDJ product line is the CDJ-3000 (2020).
          Every four years this flagship model gets a new release, with this one
          still being fairly recent. This iteration proves to be the best yet in
          terms of speed, but whenever it comes to actual new features, Pioneer
          seems to change very little over the years. The reason for this
          decision is because familiarity is key. Wherever international DJ's go
          to perform, the Pioneer gear that's present at the venue should feel
          familiar and universal within the ecosystem.<br />

          Pioneer has received a lot of backlash since this release, because
          when it comes to the actual technology driving this device, the
          manufacturer is very much behind when compared to the actual
          technological advancements in the personal computing industry. A
          highly advanced handheld device can set you back about €1.600 at most,
          while one CDJ-3000 would cost you €2.400, not accounting for the fact
          you'd need at least 2 CDJ's <i>and</i> a mixer, which would generally
          cost you well over €5.500. Arguably, that's a bit pricey for some
          music players when relativized with technology that can do much more
          than play music.<br /><br />
          The reason for this huge discourse in pricing is because CDJ's have
          much different buyer margins than mass-consumed products. Generally,
          buyers don't get new CDJ's every year, hardly even every new release.
          CDJ's are event-standard gear and not catered to bedroom/hobbyist
          DJ's, but to venues and event organisers that plan to host DJ's.

          I'm personally very satisfied with Pioneer's take on making sure new
          product releases keep the familiar layouts from their predecessors.
          This has the exact effect they intended; it wouldn't confuse me if I
          suddenly had to play on a generation of CDJ's I'm not familiar
          with.<br />

          Coincidentally, I had a show a few days ago (on the first of october)
          where this design language is exactly why I managed to perform
          successfully.<br />
